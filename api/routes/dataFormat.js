It was released as part of a package of three games entitled Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue.\n\nThe game is largely the same as its Nintendo 3DS counterpart, but includes some additional features as well as alterations designed to adapt the game to the PS4. The conversion from two screens to one is the most notable of the changes seen. Little has changed in terms of gameplay. However, three new Dream Eaters have been introduced and minor game features have been altered to adapt to the PS4.",

    summary:
      "Despite earlier rumors of a downgraded port due to the PlayStation 2's hardware limitations, this port of Resident Evil 4 have been generally favorable. Almost all the GameCube's real-time cut scenes were converted into movie files in order to maintain a better quality. Furthermore, voices and sound effects quality outside the cut-scenes had been reduced due to disc space being quickly used and audio RAM constraints. Capcom added new content made specifically for this port to compensate for the late release, such as minigames, documentaries and costumes.",
